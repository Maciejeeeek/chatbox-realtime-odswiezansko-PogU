# Original code [here.](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/Realtime-Simple-Chat-App)
**BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING!** nodeJS is **required**!

To try messing around with this ChatBox, you'll need:

```bash
$ npm i socket.io

$ npm i --save-dev nodemon

$ npm run devStart
```

For local hosting, I've used VSCode extension [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) or just find it in VSCode extensions.

Also, don't forget to change IP addresses in:

![script.js - line 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maciejeeeek/chatbox-realtime-odswiezansko-PogU/master/images/script.js%20-%20line%201.png)

After that I think that you are good to go!
