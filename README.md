# Original code [here.](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/Realtime-Simple-Chat-App)
**BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING!** nodeJS is **required**!

To try messing around with this ChatBox, you'll need:

> npm i socket.io
>
> npm i --save-dev nodemon
>
> npm run devStart

After that I think that you are good to go!
